# decision-tree
First decision tree model is build then random forest model is fitted on given data.
Accuracy of model built by both method is compared. It is observed that among both of them random forest model has highest accuracy i.e. 98%
Next cross validation method is used to improve the accuracy of model.
By cross validation method accuracy of model improved to 99%
The most important features achieved by decision tree algorithm are cheast pain, ca,thal less than 2.5,testbps less than 109,sex,oldpeak and age less than 56 years.
